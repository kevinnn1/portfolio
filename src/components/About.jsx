        I am a graduate of New York University's Tandon School of Engineering
        with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. During my
        time at NYU, I developed a large skillset in various fields of computer
        science, including AI, game development, and app development. I hope
        that the software I create for my career and personal projects can be
        enjoyed by its users. In my free time, I enjoy watching soccer, playing
        video games, and reading.
